# Welcome to the COMMITee Discord Server! 

Discord is a platform that allows people to create their own online communities, also known as servers. In these servers, members can interact via text messages, voice calls, video calls, and share a wide range of media. It's a great place to chat, discuss interests, and get to know each other better!
